# Retro Deck

*A programmable 8-key macro pad built on a raspberry pi pico with CircuitPython.*

Based on DaveM's [Stream Cheap](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2822140), the retro deck adds a slot for a screen mount to be inserted and uses a Pico instead of an Arduino Pro Micro. Dave outlines the steps to build a stream cheap [on his website](https://www.partsnotincluded.com/diy-stream-deck-mini-macro-keyboard/).
